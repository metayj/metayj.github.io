At TJU, I made friends with three remarkable individuals. Mr. Zhefeng is the most confident and assertive person I have ever met. Whenever I communicate with him, I absorb the positive energy he radiates, and I often find myself shedding negative emotions after our conversations. In summary, he is someone who inspires my motivation and boosts my self-confidence.

My next friend is Haoyang, who was my first roommate at the Jiading campus of TJU. He is the kindest and friendliest person I know. He has proven to be an excellent collaborator on group projects, such as the Urban Transportation Challenge Week from the masterâ€™s class and the Huawei Mathematical Modeling Competition. He is a warm-hearted group leader.

The last, but certainly not least, person I met is Haoran, a stylish and handsome boy from Dongbei. He possesses impressive skills, including calligraphy, basketball, and the ability to attract many admirers. He also played a significant role in igniting my passion for reading through the WeChat Read app.

As time flies by, with three years feeling like just a moment, itâ€™s now time to bid farewell to my amazing friends. Let us look forward to reuniting in our next golden era.

## Beloved Girl Friend
