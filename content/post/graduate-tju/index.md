## Outstanding Members of the STSS Lab
#### Spatio-Temporal Smart Sensing Lab

Our STSS Lab is a big family, consisting of nearly 50 team members. It was here that I met my masterâ€™s supervisor, [**Professor Chun Liu**](https://celiang.tongji.edu.cn/info/1300/2394.htm), a distinguished scientist in the field of remote sensing and photogrammetry. Thanks to his introduction to [**Professor Wei Huang**](https://huangweibuct.github.io/weihuang.github.io/), I had the honor of being the first student in Professor Huangâ€™s academic career.

In this vibrant group, Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of meeting many exceptional individuals, including **Mr. Akram**, **Ms. Jing Zhang**, **Ms. Ting Yu**, and **Ms. Weihua Huan**. They are my senior colleagues and have been incredibly supportive throughout my studies. I am very grateful for their guidance and camaraderie during my masterâ€™s degree.

I wish the STSS Lab continued success and growth.

## Memorable Experience at Huang's Lab

Huang's lab is a vibrant and energetic group, characterized by a relaxed and open research atmosphere. Over the course of two years, our team has grown by eleven members. Here, I had the privilege of working closely with my research advisor, [**Professor Wei Huang**](https://huangweibuct.github.io/weihuang.github.io/), who provided invaluable guidance on both my studies and career plans. I am deeply appreciative of his support.

During my time there, I also had the pleasure of meeting many dynamic and enthusiastic researchers, including **Ms. Zhaoyang**, **Ms. Huanying**, **Mr. Pengxiang**, **Mr. Chenghu**, and everyone who joined our team during my masterâ€™s program. It was a pleasure to work with all of you. 

I wish Huang's lab continued success and create many more valuable papers.



## My Vibrant Friends

At TJU, I made friends with three remarkable individuals. **Mr. Zhefeng** is the most confident and assertive person I have ever met. Whenever I communicate with him, I absorb the positive energy he radiates, and I often find myself shedding negative emotions after our conversations. In summary, he is someone who inspires my motivation and boosts my self-confidence.

My next friend is **Haoyang**, who was my first roommate at the Jiading campus of TJU. He is the kindest and friendliest person I know. He has proven to be an excellent collaborator on group projects, such as the Urban Transportation Challenge Week from the masterâ€™s class and the Huawei Mathematical Modeling Competition. He is a warm-hearted group leader.

The last, but certainly not least, person I met is **Haoran**, a stylish and handsome boy from Dongbei. He possesses impressive skills, including calligraphy, basketball, and the ability to attract many admirers. He also played a significant role in igniting my passion for reading through the WeChat Read app.

As time flies by, with three years feeling like just a moment, itâ€™s now time to bid farewell to my amazing friends. Let us look forward to reuniting in our next golden era.

## Beloved Girlfriend
I am very fortunate to have found my girlfriend, **Lyu Yixian**, during my most uncertain times on August 8, 2021. I am grateful for her constant encouragement and companionship. I love you deeply, and may God bless us.

## The Most Patient and Positive Parent
I am deeply grateful for my parents' immense love and support over the past years. I will cherish them forever and send my best wishes to them.
