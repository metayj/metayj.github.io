#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am currently in the third year year at [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/), pursuing a Master of Science in Urban Mobility within the [Urban Mobility Institute](https://umi.tongji.edu.cn/en/Homepage.htm) of the [College of Transportation Engineering](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/English_Home/HOME.htm). [*Sep,2021-Sep,2024*]

Before my journey at TJU, I laid my academic foundations at the [College of Engineering](https://coe.njau.edu.cn/index.htm#) of [Nanjing Agriculture University](https://english.njau.edu.cn/), where I obtained my Bachelor's degree of Engineering in Transportation. During my years there, I had the privilege of exploring the Route Planning Problems using deeplearning algorithms, which contributed to my bachelor's thesis and earned a nomination for Best Thesis. [*Sep,2017-Jul,2021*]

At TJU, the Urban Mobility Institute is an interdisciplinary institute. With my background in Transportation, and under the guidance of several professors from the [College of Surveying and Geo-informatics](https://celiang.tongji.edu.cn/english/Home.htm) at Tongji University and the [School of Resource and Environmental Sciences](https://sres.whu.edu.cn/English/Home.htm) at [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), I was responsible for tackling and completing key research components of a critical R&D project. This experience led me to shift my focus to the field of high-definition maps, focusing on HD map modeling, dynamic information organization and management, and information interaction.
