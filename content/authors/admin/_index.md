#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## ABOUT ME

#### _2025-Present_
I am a PhD student supervised by [Dr. Yan](https://discovery.nus.edu.sg/19079-yingwei-yan) at the [GIS Unit](https://nusgis.org/), affiliated with the [Department of Geography](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/geog/) at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). My current research focuses on leveraging crowdsourced data to detect and classify road features, with applications in automated vehicles and smart city development.

#### _2021-2024_
I obtained my **Master of Science Degree** in Transportation Engineering from [Urban Mobility Institute](https://umi.tongji.edu.cn/en/Homepage.htm) of the [College of Transportation](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/English_Home/HOME.htm) at [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/). Under the supervision of [Professor Huang](https://huangweibuct.github.io/weihuang.github.io/) and [Professor Liu](https://celiang.tongji.edu.cn/info/1300/2394.htm), my research focused on high-definition maps, particularly HD map modeling, dynamic information organization and management, and information interaction.

#### _2017-2021_
I laid my academic foundations at the [College of Engineering](https://coe.njau.edu.cn/index.htm#) of [Nanjing Agricultural University](https://english.njau.edu.cn/), where I obtained my **Bachelor Degree** of Engineering in Transportation.
