We introduce HDMapII, a novel approach to information interaction for connected autonomous vehicles empowered by high-definition maps. HDMapII consists of five main components: the database for HD map information management, the information interaction modes between autonomous driving vehicle and HD map, the communication methods for various types of dynamic information within HD map information database, the information communication protocol applied at different interaction modes and the approach to achieving a complete HD map information interaction process.
